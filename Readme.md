## 1. Introduction
Women Safety Analytics is a comprehensive web and mobile application designed to enhance personal safety by utilizing cutting-edge technology. The application offers real-time location tracking, crime zone classification using machine learning, and emergency alert broadcasting. Users can share their live location with trusted friends during emergencies, while law enforcement can monitor high-risk areas based on historical crime data.

## 2. Features
âœ… **User Authentication:** Secure signup, login, and logout functionality with JWT authentication.  
âœ… **Friend Management:** Users can add, invite, and remove friends who can track their location in emergencies.  
âœ… **Real-time Live Location Tracking:** Users' locations are updated in real time and visible to their selected contacts.  
âœ… **AI-Based Crime Zone Classification:** The system categorizes areas into Red, Yellow, and Green zones based on historical crime data.  
âœ… **Automatic Alerts:** When a user enters a dangerous zone, an automatic alert is broadcasted to their friends.  
âœ… **Emergency Call Feature:** Users can quickly contact emergency services like police and ambulances.  
âœ… **Suspicious Gesture Detection:** The app detects sudden movements or distress gestures and triggers alerts.  
âœ… **Image and Voice Clip Sharing:** Users can send images or voice clips during emergencies for additional context.  
âœ… **Persistent Login Sessions:** Users remain logged in even after closing the app until they manually log out.  
âœ… **Admin Panel for Law Enforcement:** Police officials can mark crime-prone areas and update historical crime records.  

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart-based mobile app)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Change Streams for real-time updates)
- **AI Model:** Python (ML-based crime zone classification)
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io
- **Notification Services:** Twilio (SMS alerts to friends and emergency contacts)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login sessions

## 4. System Architecture

```
- The **frontend** is a Flutter-based mobile application providing an interactive UI.
- The **backend** processes authentication, friend management, and location tracking.
- The **database** stores user and crime data, with real-time updates for location tracking.
- The **AI model** classifies areas into safety zones using historical crime records.
- **Socket.io** ensures real-time communication between users and their friends.
- **Admin panel** allows law enforcement to mark crime locations and update the CSV file used for AI analysis.

## 8. Frontend Overview
- **Flutter-based mobile application** providing seamless user experience.
- **Socket.io-client** is used for real-time updates and location sharing.
- **Material UI components** ensure an intuitive and accessible design.

## 9. AI Model Integration
- **Python-based ML model** analyzes historical crime data to classify locations into safety zones.
- A **Flask API** serves AI model predictions, which the backend fetches periodically.
- Crime records are maintained in a CSV file and updated dynamically through the admin panel.
- Users receive alerts based on AI-determined safety zones in real time.

## 10. Real-Time Location Sharing
- **Implemented using Socket.io** to allow live location tracking in emergency situations.
- Users can **create rooms** where friends can join and monitor their live location.
- Friends receive notifications via SMS or push notifications when a user enters a danger zone.
- Live location sharing can be toggled on/off by the user for privacy.

## 11. Admin Panel for Police
- The **admin panel** is designed specifically for law enforcement officials.
